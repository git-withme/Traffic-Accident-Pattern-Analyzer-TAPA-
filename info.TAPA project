#Goal :-
     1.To analyze traffic accident data by day, hour, and month 
     2.to find patterns and trends using visual charts, so we can better understand
        when accidents happen most often and take steps to improve road safety.


# python library:-
               1.pandas -  for Data Analysis & Manipulation like,
                                                             Reading CSV files
                                                             Cleaning and transforming data
                                                             Grouping and aggregating
               2.numpy -  Numerical Operations like,
                                                  arrays and math functions
                                                  Handling missing or NaN values
               3. matplotlib - Data Visualization like,
                                                   Plotting bar charts
                                                   line graphs
                                                   histograms

# Generate random data:-
 generates a sample dataset of 300 random traffic accident records with dates (Date), times (Time), and
 severity levels (Severity) using NumPy and Pandas. It then creates a DataFrame df that simulates real
 accident data for further analysis.


 # Combine Date and Time, Extract Time Features:-
 the Date column is in datetime format and the Time column is treated as a string, then combines them into 
 a single DateTime column.It then extracts useful features like,
                                                          hour
                                                          weekday name
                                                          month name  for time-based analysis.


# Data Visualization:-
the accident data to count how many accidents occurred on each weekday, during each hour of the day,
and in each month. It ensures the output is sorted in a logical order (e.g., Monday to Sunday and January to December)
and displays the results for easy interpretation

# plotting the charts:-
to creates a 2x2 grid of visualizations to display accident trends:
                        1. a bar chart - for average accidents by weekday,
                        2. a line chart - for hourly distribution, a bar chart for monthly totals
                        3. a histogram - to show the frequency of monthly accidents.
 It uses matplotlib to customize each plot with titles, labels, and colors for clear and comparative analysis.

 # future scope:-
           1.The TAPA project can be expanded by using real-world traffic data, adding features like weather and location
             and applying machine learning to predict accident risks. 
           2.It can also include map-based visualizations, real-time monitoring, and interactive dashboards
            to support smarter road safety decisions.
